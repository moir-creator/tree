In this repository, I worked with binary tree as a data structure and developed the following methods:
- add
- addRecursive
- searchMin & searchMax
- remove //.. in development
- searchDataLink //.. return the link on Node
- searchData
- countLeft & countRight //.. non recursive and approximately inaccurate count
- isBalance
- copyTree //.. coppy the data of tree on sorted array
- deleteTree
- countNodes
- reBalance //.. in development
- output

In this repository, I worked with binary tree as a data structure and developed the following methods:
- add
- addRecursive
- searchMin & searchMax
- remove //.. in development
- searchDataLink //.. return the link of Node
- searchData //bool return "true" if data is in Tree, else "false"
- searchDataWay //.. left->right->left
- countLeft & countRight //.. non recursive and approximately inaccurate count
- isBalance
- copyTree //.. coppy the data of tree on sorted array
- deleteTree
- nodesCount
- reBalance // copy the data of Tree in sorted arr[], then link the mediana to the Head 
- output
